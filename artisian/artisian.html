            </select>. Pecknold and Skjelset were the 2 that originally bonded and started making music together; influenced by their parents' music tastes. They were also inspired by Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson, which made them realize the importance of practicing music from a young age. The original name of the band was going to be "The Pineapples" but was changed to "Fleet Foxes" because it clashed with another local band name.</p>
        <p>The band has released 2 albums. One titles "Fleet Foxes" made in 2008 and the other "Helplessness Blues" made in 2011. They have also released several singles and music videos. In 2013 there was speculation of a possible third album to be released, but no further moves have been made since then.</p>
